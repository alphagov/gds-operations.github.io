## Open source software from GDS Operations

The UK [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk) maintains a number
of open source software [projects](projects) which were conceived for use on
[GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) and other initiatives we work on.

By releasing these projects as open source software, we hope that our work may
benefit government departments, and outside institutions, and conversely that
usage and contributions from outside of GDS be beneficial to these projects'
quality and utility.

Each project aims to abide by our [open source guidelines](guidelines).

Unless stated otherwise, all of our open source software is released under
the [MIT licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and is therefore free to
use. Contributions are appreciated and much encouraged.
