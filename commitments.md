We welcome pull requests and bug reports on our Open Source projects, and this document details our process for dealing with them so what you can expect from us.

## Pull Requests

As stated in our contributing guidelines (for example, the [vCloud Core contributing guidelines](https://github.com/gds-operations/vcloud-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)), we will comment on your pull request within two working days, to let you know we've seen it.

What we do at this point is raise a story in our backlog to review that PR. How quickly we get to that depends on how complex the change is and what other work priorities we have at the time, so it might take a bit of time to get reviewed.

However, we do really appreciate external pull requests so it will be relatively high priority. If you feel it has been too long, then you are welcome to 'bump' the pull request by making another comment on it.

## Bug reports

We also appreciate bug reports, and the process is similar. We will acknowledge the bug report within a few days and raise a story in our backlog to investigate it.

However, unless it is an urgent security-related bug, it is likely to have a lower priority than a pull request, so it may take quite a while to get to the top of the list. We will look at it, but if it's an urgent issue for you, it might be worth thinking about raising a pull request. As noted in our contributing guidelines, we are very happy to help if you have questions about how to raise a PR.
